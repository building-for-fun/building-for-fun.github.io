## ðŸ“š Algorithm Series: Sliding Window Technique

#### 1. What is the Sliding Window?

The sliding window is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve problems that involve a subset of data elements (often in arrays or lists). It works by maintaining a window (a subset of the array) that slides across the data to examine different parts of it without having to reprocess the entire dataset.

#### 2. Why Do We Use It?

We use the sliding window technique to optimize problems that involve contiguous subarrays. By avoiding the recomputation of elements that fall out of the window, it significantly reduces time complexity, making the algorithm more efficient.

#### 3. Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - The algorithm processes each element only once as it slides the window across the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Only a fixed amount of additional space is used, regardless of the input size.

#### 4. Code Sample in Java

```java
public class SlidingWindow {
    public int maxSumSubArray(int[] arr, int k) {
        int maxSum = 0, windowSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            windowSum += arr[i];
        }
        maxSum = windowSum;

        for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
            windowSum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
        }

        return maxSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SlidingWindow sw = new SlidingWindow();
        int[] arr = {1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2};
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println("Maximum sum of subarray of size " + k + ": " + sw.maxSumSubArray(arr, k));
    }
}
```
