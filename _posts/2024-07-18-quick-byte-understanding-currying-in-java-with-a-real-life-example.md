## ðŸ”¹ Quick Byte: Understanding Currying in Java with a Real-Life Example ðŸ”¹

**Currying:** A technique in functional programming where a function is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. It breaks down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take one argument.

### Real-Life Example: Discount Calculation in E-Commerce
Let's consider an e-commerce application where we need to apply different discount strategies based on the user type (e.g., regular customer, member, VIP) and the product category (e.g., electronics, clothing).
Hereâ€™s an example using currying to apply these discounts:

```java
import java.util.function.Function;

public class CurryingExample {
    // Curried function to apply discount based on user type and product category
    public static Function<String, Function<String, Function<Double, Double>>> discountCalculator =
        userType -> productCategory -> price -> {
            double discount = 0.0;

            // Apply discount based on user type
            switch (userType) {
                case "Regular":
                    discount += 0.05;
                    break;
                case "Member":
                    discount += 0.10;
                    break;
                case "VIP":
                    discount += 0.15;
                    break;
            }

            // Apply additional discount based on product category
            switch (productCategory) {
                case "Electronics":
                    discount += 0.05;
                    break;
                case "Clothing":
                    discount += 0.10;
                    break;
            }

            // Calculate final price after applying discounts
            return price * (1 - discount);
        };

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double finalPrice = discountCalculator.apply("Member").apply("Electronics").apply(200.0);
        System.out.println("Final price after discount: $" + finalPrice); // Outputs: Final price after discount: $170.0
    }
}
```


### Explanation:
* Currying Function: discountCalculator takes userType, then productCategory, and finally the price to calculate the discounted price.
* Chained Application: The function is applied in a chained manner: discountCalculator.apply("Member").apply("Electronics").apply(200.0).
* Result: The final price after applying the discounts is calculated and printed.

### Benefits of Currying in This Example:
* Modular Calculation: Discounts are calculated in a modular way, making it easy to add or change discount rules.
* Reusability: Partial functions (e.g., discounts for specific user types or product categories) can be reused with different prices.
* Readability: The code is more readable and maintainable due to the clear separation of concerns.
